## FAQ

<details>
 <summary> Q: My Follower is missing and I can't find them! What do I do? </summary>
<br>
A: It happens, sometimes they go off and do their own thing, chase after a churlish deer that called them a milk drinker, or perhaps you left them somewhere and forgot where they call home. 
Using the RefID of the follower in question, type the following into your console.

 prid RefID

followed by 

 moveto player

and that should put them in front of you.

 <summary>Q: Why are there are perks missing from my followers entry.</summary>
<br>
A: By quirk of code or some other error, some followers lack either some of their perks prerequisites or any perks at all. We're working on bringing all followers up to par with one another in future updates.
