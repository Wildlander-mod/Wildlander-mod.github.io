### Save Advice

The problem in a heavily modded set up is that it has a ton of script heavy mods. Sometimes a script will get paused for saving, and that script won’t be able to recover properly from it’s paused state. This leads to a corrupted save. Another possibility is that your computer is already under so much strain from the scripts that the save function can actually cause a C.T.D when trying to save, typically this occurs during a load screen, but can also occur when the weather is changing.

The point being that not using auto-saves can help with avoiding ctd's and hence corrupted save files when you try to load one after a C.T.D. In addition, Auto-saves increase cell loading times by 500%, so it’s preferable to manually save before entering a cell, rather than have it integrated into the loading screen.

Autosaves (and quicksaves for that matter) are not bad intrinsically, it’s that there are an insufficient number of them if something goes wrong, leading to the possibility of many lost hours of gameplay progress - Or worse case the entire character. This is why wildlander makes the "quicksave" hotkey perform a full save instead.

TL;DR Autosaves are ok, but timing is what determines if they’re likely to cause issues. Having multiple saves to use limits the amount of play lost to script-death.

Instead, practice Safe Saving

* When you load your save file, wait at least a minute before saving again. Some scripts will break if you save too soon after loading.
* Avoid saving during combat or other conditions of heavy script load.
* Never save more than once a minute.
* Never save within 30 seconds of entering a building / cell / dungeon.
* After waiting/sleeping, wait a minute to allow all the NPC's AI scripts to move to where they are supposed to be

### When starting a new character

If you have played a character already and then exit to the main menu, do _not_ attempt to start a new character in the same session. Instead, quit entirely out of Skyrim and restart it from there. If you do not do so, the game will not operate properly and you will get errors such as 'please restart the economy' or 'Honed Metal has crashed.'

This *isn't* a bug with the list. Skyrim does not handle you playing one character, returning to the menu, and then starting a second. This is because Skyrim doesn't unload all of the previous games scripts and can cause severe issues with your new play-through (hotkeys not working, broken economy, merchants with no gold, or your character leveling up when they shouldn't be).

Every time you want to start a new character, you should be closing and reopening Skyrim in its entirety.

Please ***DO NOT*** report bugs relating to this topic as its a flaw with Skyrim itself. There is nothing we can do to make this work!

### Content not covered by the wiki.

Several topics are not covered by the wiki because the are mechanically unchanged from vanilla. Some examples of this includes

1. Quests - The quests themselves are unchanged in terms of contents. What has changed about some of them is the level requirements due to the difficulty of the quest or location (this mostly affects Daedric quests) 
1. Staff Enchanting - this is unchanged from vanilla Dragonborn
1. How to build a hearthfire home. The fundamentals of this and requirements are unchanged.
1. Civil war - Changing this would be like sticking a band-aid on a decapitation

The general rule should be - if using the wiki search bar doesn't find a result - its not changed from Vanilla.
