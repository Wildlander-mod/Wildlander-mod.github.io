Automatons are constructs of dwarven origin and can most often be found in dwemer ruins. Those encountered in Skyrim seem to be magically operated, as soul gems can be found in their remains, but how they function as a whole remains a secret. In general, they all share a strong resistance to physical damage due to their massive metal bodies, but can be dispatched relatively easily with shock based spells and enchantments, probably because they disrupt the magic that animates them.
They are golden colored, strong robotic creations made by the Dwemer.

### Dwarven Spider

The weakest form of dwarven automatons. Shaped like a spider, they're also the smallest of constructs encountered. However, they are even faster than the Spheres and sometimes have an active crystal mounted on their top that is capable of producing lethal strikes of lightning. When approaching in large numbers, it is highly advised to either flee or make use of spells that damage multiple ones.

### Dwarven Sphere

A less durable form of the dwarven automatons, the dwarven sphere is more common than the centurion. However, it's much faster and can maneuver much better than the former - most often, they are still patrolling in the more narrow sections of the dwarven ruins. They're generally equipped with a melee weapon and a crossbow, allowing them to either engage in close combat or attack from afar.

### Dwarven Ballista

Ballistae are ranged attackers that will make every effort to stay as far away from their targets as possible and assail them with high-power ballista bolts from a distance. Their attacks are particularly powerful, will stagger those they hit. For this reason, they are high priority targets to remove as soon as possible whenever they are encountered. An effective strategy for combating them is to stay at range and evade their attack, and then rush them and attempt to defeat them before they have a chance to reload their ballista bolt.

### Dwarven Centurion

The Centurion is one of the greatest inventions of dwemic craftmanship and proves to be a very dangerous foe. It's massive metal body provides an exceptional protection from all forms of physical damage and is unpenetrable by common arrows, making unenchanted bows practically useless and turning every melee fight into a very long lasting encounter. It's only weakness seems to be electric energy, as the exposure to such seems to overcharge the construct and thereby destroying the magical mechanisms that keep it running. However, some if not all of them have the ability to shoot forth streams of hot steam that can cook human-like creatures alive. If one wants to approach them in melee combat, it's most likely suicide if the daredevil does not use some sort of fire protection.

### The Forgemaster

The Forgemaster is a powerful Dwarven Centurion that guards the Aetherium Forge. The Forgemaster is slightly larger in size than normal Centurions, still appearing partially molten due to its long slumber in the lava, and breathes a gout of fire instead of steam. The fire it breathes will also linger on the ground for some time, causing low-medium fire damage.

### Enchanted Sphere

A much more Larger, rarer form of the Dwarven Sphere, and much more dangerous. It's massive metal body provides an exceptional protection from all forms of physical damage and is unpenetrable by common arrows, coupled with health regeneration which is only slowed by electirical discharges. It's weapon is coated in a powerful toxin which deals ever increasing damage per hit. Its crossbow is enchanted with shock damage.

For any adventure foolish enough to take one on, poison and shock resistance is therefore a must, along with shock enchanted blunt weaponry to reduce its healing.
