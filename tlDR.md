## THERE IS NO TL;DR.

**Reading isn't Optional** We provide an extensive wiki which answers a lot of questions in detail. At the very minimum, Recommended reading section should be read.

This wiki also contains the getting started guide, plus all the Mod list documentation relating to the new mechanics.

For some shortcuts
* the current [modlists](https://airtable.com/shry9PXLi3ON9Lbtn/tbl7ZahJNkl97qi3j?backgroundColor=yellow&viewControls=on) 
* [Change logs](https://wiki.wildlandermod.com/14ModlistVersions/CHANGELOG/)
* [Known Issues & Workarounds](https://wiki.wildlandermod.com/01Support/KnownIssues/)
* [FAQ](https://wiki.wildlandermod.com/01Support/Faq/)

Support asks that you search the wiki before asking any questions. Some pages however (E.G modlists, crafting, Armor, known issues) are hosted on Airtable - Which as better searching/filtering capabilities. So you will need to load those specific pages to search them. 

For everything else, you can search the wiki using the searchbar pinned to the top of the right hand window. Just click and type your keywords.
