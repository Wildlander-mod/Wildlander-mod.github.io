Wildlander has passive health regeneration set to 0%. You will not heal from your wounds by "sleeping it off" or waiting like in vanilla. 

When you get hurt fighting - the only ways to heal are :-

- Restoration spells (for the living)
- Conjouration spells (for the undead)
- Health potions (For undead, only max level healing potions (superlative) will work.)
- Healing Poultice (see note below) 
- Alchemy Perk
- Raw Ingredients
- Enchantments
- Engraved bones (Kynareth): gives passive health regen for the duration.

## Health regeneration Calculations

There are several actor values involved in calculating total health regeneration:

1. The players's maximum Health.
1. The HealRate.  expresses the percentage of maximum health that is regenerated per second, real time. This is set to 7%
1. The HealRateMult. expresses a percentage modifier to the base HealRate. This is the value modified by most sources of +health regen enchants, items and potions. This is set to 0% by default
1. The CombatHealthRegenMult. expresses an additional multiplier that is only active while in combat. This is set to 7%

This equates to this passive health regeneration formula:

HealthPerSecond = MaximumHealth * HealRate% * HealRateMult% * (IsInCombat ? CombatHealthRegenMult : 1.0)

Changes made to the HealRateMult actor value in wildlander are additive, E.g. using a 5% enchant and a 100% potion will increase your "HealRateMult" to 105%  (0% base + 5% + 100%)


## Healing Poultice 

Healing poultices are SLOW action healers, but heal for a lot. If you engage in combat or sprint while the effect is active, it will be suspended for the duration of said combat or sprint action, and reactivate a few seconds after. It is therefore recommended that you only use healing poultices in a safe place, and that you wait for at least an hour for the effect to work.
