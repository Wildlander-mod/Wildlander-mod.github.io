## --Mechanics--

### [ Attack Stamina Cost ]

In Requiem, attacks with weapons cost a bit of stamina. The cost differs wih 1H / 2H, and scales with weight of the weapon. Meaning, a dagger will cost less stamina per swing than a mace.

Depending on your One-handed skill level, the Stamina cost for attacks with One-handed weapons will decrease more : at 100 One-handed skill, it will cost 1/4 of what it takes at 0 One-handed skill.

### [ Perk Bonus Calculation ]

Attack Speed bonuses are additive for each perks. If you have Flurry (Rank 2) and Sword Focus (Rank 3), the bonus is : 25% (Flurry) + 24% (Sword Focus) = 49% faster attack speed.

Power Attack damage bonuses are multiplicative for each perks. If you have Powerful Strikes and Storm of Steel, Power Attacks do : 1.2 (Powerful Strikes) * 1.25 (Storm of Steel) = 1.5 --> 50% more Power Attack damage.

Power Attack cost reduction bonuses are multiplicative for each perks. If you have Penetrating Strikes and Dexterity (in Evasion skill, when wearing no heavy armor), Power Attacks cost : 0.5 * 0.76 = 0.38 --> 62% less Power Attack Stamina cost (38% of original cost).

### [ Armor Penetration when Dual-Wielding ]

When Dual-Wielding different types of One-handed weapons, One-handed Armor Penetration given from Focus perks are halved for each weapon. So if you have unperked weapon in one hand, you'll have even less Armor Penetration than when single-handed.

When Dual-Wielding, Armor Penetration is shared for both hands. So if you have perked Sword and Dagger in your hand, they will have same Armor Penetration.

If you have 14 Armor Penetration for your sword and 30 Armor Penetration for your mace, you will get (14+30)/2 = 22 Armor Penetration.

Exact mechanics: holding any 1h weapon type, 50% of the corresponding focus perk AP is active, the other half is only applied when the other hand holds either nothing (empty) a shield, a magic spell, a scroll or a torch (should be nearly always the case).
