## Description

This is the "standard" Barbarian for Requiem according to GreedGaming. The video guide was Created using the 1.0 version of pack but 90% of the information is still valid (Alchemy has less Ingredient availability and Eorlund's not available until you are part of the circle) .

He chooses Mage Armor and Steed stone for starting spell & Stone. Along with the Orc for berserker rage.

Rather than do the traditional character Guide - i'm going to suggest that you watch his video's as its explained very well inside

Race | Stone | Blessing | Supernatural
|--|--|--|--|
Orc | Steed | Talos/Stendarr/Zenithar | Werewolf
