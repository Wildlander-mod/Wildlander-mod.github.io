## Ultimate Skyrim Modding Basics

Installing Mods not covered by guides. 

- Download it to your UltSky download folder (this will be the directory you entered on the Wabbajack installer when you first installed the list)
- open < Ultimate Skyrim install directory >\content\mod organizer.exe. Once open - top left drop-down - select the profile you plan on playing.
- select download tab on right side 
- find the mod in the list and right click > install (you may need to click the refresh button to make it appear)
- choose your settings (if it has installation options) then once its finished installing turn it on, on the left side of the mod organizer (should be at bottom of the list). 
- **Important** if patching from "Requiem patch central" Untick any ticked patches for mods in the base Ultsky install, and only tick ones for mods you are adding yourself.

If you mod doesn’t have any ESP/ESM's then that’s it - otherwise continue!

Sort your (right side) Plugins load order **manually** (LOOT IS THE DEVIL - ERASE its Existence from your memory).

Firstly, There are specific guides in this document for a lot of the more popular mods, along with proper Ultsky patches & install instructions, so check those first!

If there isn't a specific guide, then as a general rule of thumb 
* Anything that adds spells, weapons, followers or other types of NPCs should go ABOVE Requiem.esp (right pane of MO2)
* Patches always have to be below the mod they are patching, thus the requiem patches will be below Requiem.esp by the other requiem patches while your mod will be above Requiem.esp.
* Any mods which are NPC overhauls should follow the same installation process as Bijin (in the [NPC Overhaul Guide](#npc-overhaul-guide))
* Any mods which don't Add new NPCS, followers, Spells and weapons, should be installed below the Ultimate Skyrim patches, but above Warburg's Paper world map. (E.g. Autosave manager, bathtubs Basins and beyond, tentpalooza)

![Modding Rules](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/790534021380964382/834791598964604948/unknown.png)

Setup and run the Reqtificator as per the instructions in the [FAQ](https://wiki.wildlandermod.com/16OtherResources/UltSkyFAQ/##reqtificator-questions)

Close mod organizer - and use the launcher to start the game.

## Known Mod Issues/Incompatibilities

The following Types of mods are NOT Compatible. (cause game breaking bugs)
> * Any Alternate start mod. (Ultimate Skyrim reborn is included in the list, which acts as a alternate start mod. It cannot be removed and replaced with something else)
> * Any Mod which affects the perk trees E.g. Ordinator 
> * Truly Absorb Dragon Souls, DSAMG - Dragon Soul Absorb More Glorious and Dragon Remains (prevents the main quest from firing upon killing a dragon)
> * UltSky Starting items for 4.0.6hf2 (Breaks Ultimate Skyrim reborn, character wont teleport after creating and doesn’t have the promised items anyway!)
> * New Races                          (unless requiem patch available) Requiem won’t start and will return you to the main menu.
> * Skyrim Together (Just doesn't work)  

The following Mods are extremely script heavy, Will possibly break your game.
> *  Enhanced Blood Textures (known to cause fps degradation/script bloat)
> *  Open Cities (also requires a tonne of manual patching)
> *  Sexlab Seperate Orgasms (known to cause fps degradation/script bloat)

The following types of mods have Issues 
> *  New creatures/enemies/NPC's/followers   (unless requiem patch available) - Note: for enemies - they are generally added as unleveled, and in requiem this means they are always level 1. for NPC's and Followers - they will be missing the requiem perks and may also be unleveled (ergo level 1)
> *  Dead NPC Body Cleaner Remover (caused Immortal Vampires when you attempt to burn them, also causes civil war patrols to scream like banshee's)  
> *  Important Information Overhaul (Just doesn’t work with our ENB)
> *  New Quest area mods   (unless requiem patch available) - Note: This is because new area's generally add new creatures/enemies/NPC's and followers
> *  3Tweaks (We use Requiem 3.0.2, 3tweaks requires 3.4. It also changes so much stuff, that it won't be compatible with anything without 3tweaks dedicated patch - which just dont exist for the bulk of the mods in the list - Including Ultimateskyrim.esp itself).

## Anna Gameplay Overhaul Guide

If you enjoy the following play-styles and themes, these MCM settings and extra mods might be perfect for you:

> - Deadly, realistic combat with longer-term consequences.
> - Immersive world experience with minimally intrusive HUD/mechanical elements.
> - Enhanced NPC interactions with more in-world characters.
> - Warrior, thief, and lower magic play-styles.
> - Civil War and military playthroughs.
> - Slower, grinding pace of play. 
> - *EXTREMELY HARDCORE*    

You can get a lot of this experience from the default UltSky list, but the added mods and plugins in this guide really turn it up to 11 for me.   
    
Please note: 
This guide was designed using the 4.0.7 modpack, and some of the mods featured in the MCM setup area and no longer included (Nether’s Follower Framework), BURVARP now requires wintersun, and Phintweaks is included in the base build so installation is no longer necessary. You can see Anna's modwatch here https://modwat.ch/u/cascadianna/plugins .

## Autosave Manager

Auto-saves trigger when loading into a Cell - when all the scripts are running that can corrupt a save and increase your load times massively.

I use autosave manager because it is a mod itself - and therefore triggers the save a few seconds after entering a cell, by which time all of the scripts should have fired. The only drawback is the game freezes for a few seconds while making the save. [Link Here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/34842/)

It is also highly configurable so you can automate saves at more places than you would be able to in vanilla saves.

Installation Instructions:

On the RIGHT side:
> - Load patch BELOW Ultimate Skyrim's patches, ABOVE Automatic Variants (and paper world map if you have this in your load order).

In the MCM - I use the following settings: -

In save events 
> * I have mine set to Manual save on Rest/Wait/Arrive at destination/ discover location/dungeon clear.
> * I have it set to do an Incremental every 30 mins.
> * I can do a manual save on f4.

Save conditions tab.
> * Left as default.

General settings tab
> * Save delay - 6 seconds.
> * Script delay - as high as I could set it.
> * I also limited the number of incremental saves to 15

Finally
> * I disabled auto-saving via the Skyrim settings menu completely.

### Wintersun - Faiths of Skyrim* [Guide updated 2021/04/02]

Even if you are familiar with[ Wintersun](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/95545?tab=description), do check out the changes in[ Seg's Requiem patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/95859?tab=description) used here. Some of the tweaks are significant.

About the Ult Sky patch:

* _Forwarded all relevant scripts from "Book Covers Skyrim" book records. Retained book models and inventory art from "Book Covers Skyrim" mod._
* _Fixed a minor error in Stendarr's Fortify Block effect._
* _Arkay's Chalice of Life restoration effect now works as intended. Requiem's "No Natural Regen" permanent spell was blocking it._
* _Forwarded the appropriate quest activators that unlock the various daedric blessings._
* _Applied quest journal logs from "Even Better Quest Objectives" mod._
* _Resolved a script conflict with "House of Horrors Alternate Ending" mod._
* _Fixed a few invalid references in Seg's patch (it was made for an older version of Wintersun)._
* _Resolved a few magic effect conflicts related to blessings, and a couple of quest conflicts with "The Choice is Yours" mod._

To install:

1. Download and install[ Wintersun 3.1.5](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/95545?tab=files) with MO2. Load the esp plugin anywhere between _Book Covers Skyrim.esp_ and _Requiem.esp._ On the screen shot below it is right before _Requiem.esp_. Mod position on the left side of MO does not matter (end of the mod list is fine).
2. Download and install[ Wintersun - Requiem patch (v1.4)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/95859?tab=files) from Segolia94's patch collection. Load the esp between _Ultimate Skyrim.esp_ and _Requiem for the Indifferent.esp_.
3. Install [Wintersun 3.1.5 - Seg 1.4 - Ultsky 407](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hP53c8KQQz4plQGNl-qlLSpMnYFRVy0d/view?usp=sharing) On the left side of MO2 keep this patch **after** Wintersun mod and Seg's patch. On the right side of MO load the esp **after** Seg's patch and also **after** _Ultimate Skyrim - Book Covers Skyrim.esp_ **_._** You can place both patches there, as shown on the screenshot below.
4. Run the [Reqtificator](https://wiki.wildlandermod.com/16OtherResources/UltSkyFAQ/##reqtificator-questions). Done.

_Note: If you are a Sanguine worshiper, and you are also using SNBCJ's "Requiem - Classic Food and Drink (R-CFD)" mod, make sure to load the Wintersun patches after the R-CFD patch, so that you'll get the correct effect from alcohol which boosts favor with Sanguine the more you drink._

*_Installing over an existing save:_

_Starting a new game is always the safest option when installing scripted mods. From my limited testing it seems to work fine when installed mid-game. Just make sure to let any active blessings expire before installing._

### Sacrosanct - Vampires of Skyrim with Seg's patch* [Patch updated 2019/08/21]


Refer to the[ Sacrosanct](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/80159?tab=description) page for mod features, and also see the change log for[ Segolia94's Sacrosanct-Requiem Patch v1.2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/95859?tab=description) which tweaks a few minor aspects of the mod for better synergy with Requiem.

This is a tweaked version of Seg's patch, uploaded with permission.

**Changes**:

- Fixed a bug in **Vampiric Drain** spell (Seg's patch) where the spell magnitude did not scale properly with hunger stages, i.e. it stayed at a constant 5 HP/sec at every stage. Now the drain spell has correct magnitude of **5/10/15/20 HP/sec** (stages 1-4). This is half as strong as the Requiem spell, with reversed progression. If you want the spell to be strongest at stage 1 and weakest at stage 4 as it is in Requiem, enable "Reverse Progression" in the Sacrosanct MCM.

- Fixed a condition error in Vampiric Drain stage 3 (Seg's patch).

- Tweak: **Weakness to Fire** is brought back to Sacrosanct levels: -**20%/-30%/-40%/-50%** (stages 1-4), instead of Requiem levels (-75%/-85%/-100%/-150%). This seems appropriate since the vampire character no longer receives the insanely strong +300 HP/SP buff from Requiem, but instead only **+50 HP/SP** buff.

- **Frost Resistance** remains unchanged: **+50%/+40%/+30%/+20%** (stages 1-4)

To install:


1. Download and install[ Sacrosanct v5.15](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/80159?tab=files) using MO2. On the left side keep the mod after Ultimate Skyrim mod (end of the mod list is fine). On the right side load _Sacrosanct - Vampires of Skyrim.esp_ anywhere **between** _Ultimate Skyrim.esp_ and _Warburg's 3D Paper World Map_.
2. Download and install[ Requiem 3.x - SCS 5.15 - RaceCompat 1.107 Patch](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eSqCffbxL2BKPc7auVkS8bsPhcQwwLsS/view?usp=sharing) and place it after Sacrosanct mod on the left side of MO. Load the esp plugin **after** _Sacrosanct - Vampires of Skyrim.esp_ on the right. _[Note: Load both esp's_ **_after_** _SNBCJ's mods and patches if you have any of them installed (e.g. Classic Food and Drink or Immersive Divine Blessings).]_
3. Run the [Reqtificator](https://wiki.wildlandermod.com/16OtherResources/UltSkyFAQ/##reqtificator-questions). Done.

Load Order: Left and right side of MO2 shown below.

MCM settings:



* **Allow regeneration in Shadows:** I always enable this option because it allows for some interesting RP and combat strategies when engaging enemies outside during the day, when my stats are debuffed due to sunlight. Hide behind any object that blocks direct sunlight to regain stat regeneration. Cloudy weather works too.
* **Trespassing Curse: Disable -** The 'curse', which is active by default, drains your magicka and stamina as soon as you enter someone's property illegally. I disable it because that never made sense to me.
* **Fortitude: Disable** - The Fortitude ability is a bit OP so I disable it. It auto-resurrects you when you die in Sated state, and then makes you Thirsty. It has no cooldown and can be easily exploited for infinite lives, if you harvest enough blood potions and keep yourself Sated at all times. It's also a bit redundant since you also have the Blood Cauldron active power, which fully restores all 3 stats and is much more fun to use.
* **Vampiric Drain: Enable Reverse Progression** - by default, the Vampiric Drain spell grows in magnitude the hungrier you become, i.e. it is the weakest when you are Sated (5 HP/sec), and strongest when you are Blood Starved (20 HP/sec). If you prefer Requiem's reverse progression (strongest when sated, weakest when starved), enable this setting.

*_Installing on an existing save:_

_A_ _new game_ _is always recommended with any scripted mod. Having said that, I have not encountered any issues after installing and loading my old template save. I was able to use the vampiric powers right away, including feeding, draining, Vampire's Command / Seduction / Sight / Will._

### Andromeda - Unique Standing Stones of Skyrim* [Guide updated 2020/09/15]
    
This[ standing stone overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/89219?tab=description) allows for some very interesting play styles. It is pretty much compatible out of the box, with one minor exception pertaining to the Undeath mod (optional patch posted). I haven't changed anything in terms of balance because nothing strikes me as balance-breaking at first glance (_EDIT: see comments below_), but I've only just started using the mod. Do leave some feedback if you think something needs tweaking.

As in base Requiem, once you choose a standing stone, you can only switch to other stones within the[ same group](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimrequiem/wiki/standing_stones#wiki_standing_stones_of_requiem_.28v_3.0.29).

To install:

1. Download and install[ Andromeda 1.0.9](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/89219?tab=files) with MO2. Load the esp **after** _Ultimate Skyrim.esp_ on the right side of MO.
2. Download and install[ Andromeda 1.0.9 - Ultsky 4.0.7 MCM Descriptions](https://mega.nz/file/aVsl0YJa#6yaVKCFutL85qcqChc668d7udVCu8ASKO5YT9KhTBQU) to update the descriptions in the Ult Sky MCM. No plugin here, just a text file. On the left side of MO keep this patch **after** _Ultimate Skyrim_ mod.
3. [Optional] Install the patch[ Andromeda - Undeath Ritual Stone patch](https://drive.google.com/open?id=141SgIO7hjle7Y2j-YHv2-edYak74AROS) if you intend to play the Undeath quest line. Load the plugin **after** _Andromeda - Unique Standing Stones of Skyrim.esp_ on the right side.
4. Run the [Reqtificator](https://wiki.wildlandermod.com/16OtherResources/UltSkyFAQ/##reqtificator-questions). Done.



![alt_text](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/852619952845750302/912840754131517450/unknown.png "image_tooltip")


_Installing_ _on an existing save:_

If you install this mod mid-game, the standing stones in Skyrim will be updated, but your currently active abilities may not be updated automatically. To reset your active powers after installing the mod, travel to a different standing stone in the[ same group](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimrequiem/wiki/standing_stones#wiki_standing_stones_of_requiem_.28v_3.0.29) and activate it. Then travel back to your original standing stone and re-activate it. See the stone locations[ here](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Standing_Stone). (To speed up the process you can use 'coc' in the console to teleport to each standing stone. The "Console Location Code" is listed on the individual standing stone pages).

```
Changelog:
- Bugfix - Removes conflict with Skyrim unbound reborn so that MCM options are not messed up.

```
Changelog:
- Bugfix - Removes conflict with Skyrim unbound reborn so that MCM options are not messed up.

- Updated Khajit and Argonian races (including vampire) to keep their Ultimate Skyrim perks.
    - Claw attack for argonian
    - Perkless lockpicking for Khajiit
```


### Requiem - Immersive Divine Blessings (R-IDB) v1.31

**_Note: Aside from blessings, the mod also tweaks certain items and gear, so I recommend taking some time to read through the[ Nexus page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/90691) to learn about the changes. A notable example is the Necromancer's Amulet - the mod raises the minimum magicka requirement to equip it from 150 to 300 base magicka._**

_Also , the mod comes with[ Requiem - Werewolf and Vampire Rebalance (W&VR)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/87420) fully integrated, which changes vampire / werewolf stats. If you are going to play as one of those races, you may want to read that mod page._

_If you want to use R-IDB with **Sacrosanct**, load the Sacrosanct mod and patch plugins after IDB patch plugin._

_About the 4.0.6 HF2 patch._

_All the blessings from the mod description remain intact. IDB also tweaks some gear and items that are meant to synergize with the various blessings. Those are also intact, except I mostly kept Ult Sky's item names, value and weight stats, in order to preserve the balance of the economy. The Akatosh blessing was tweaked to account for the fact that Skyrim Unbound skips the first few quests in the Main Quest sequence. It should apply the appropriate effects as though those quests were properly completed._

_To install:_



1. _Download and install the main file[ Requiem - Immersive Divine Blessings 1.31](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/90691?tab=files) using MO2. On the right side of MO the plugin should be loaded **between** Requiem.esp and Ultimate Skyrim.esp (screenshot below). On the left side of MO, R-IDB should override Requiem 3.0.x to win any file conflicts. It's fine to leave it at the end of the mod list._
2. _Download the patch archive ([R-IDB 1.31 UltSky 406HF2 patch](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vZRbFBXgjlJ-2GvkUcNiqhf3y0guDmM8)) and install in MO2. On the right side move the plugin **between** Ultimate Skyrim.esp and Automatic Variants.esp. If you don't have AV installed, the plugin can be loaded anywhere between Ultimate Skyrim.esp and Requiem for the Indifferent.esp. Mod order on the left side is not important._
3. _Run the [Automatic Variants](https://github.com/phinocio/UltimateSkyrim/blob/master/Docs/Patchers.md#automatic-variants)  patcher.
4. _Run the [Reqtificator](https://wiki.wildlandermod.com/16OtherResources/UltSkyFAQ/##reqtificator-questions). Done. (**Note: Remember to re-run both patchers if you remove IDB from your load order later on.**)_


_*Installing **R-IDB** on an existing save: All shrines and amulets should work right off the bat, but make sure to clear any active effects from old blessings._


### Requiem - Immersive Abilities (R-IA) v8.0

**_[The patch for R-IA v1.6 works with R-IA v8.0 and US 4.0.6 HF2]_**

_[Requiem - Immersive Abilities](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/96880) fixes a few balance issues with the races in base Requiem. For example, the Altmer's extreme 40% weakness to Magic is replaced with 25% weakness to Fire, Frost, and Shock, which makes it a more viable option. Read about all the changed on the mod page._

_About the patch: The one significant change in the patch is the addition of the "IsAdultRace" keyword from the Immersive Children mod, which is required in all race records. Also, the patch contains the changes from "Requiem - IA Chasing the Dragon Plus patch 1.2"[ provided by SNBCJ](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/96880?tab=files) for Requiem 3.X compatibility, so there is no need to install that file._

_To install:_



1. _Download and install[ Requiem - Immersive Abilities 8.0](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/96880?tab=files) (**main file only!**). Mod placement on the left side of MO2 doesn't matter. On the right side place Requiem - Immersive Abilities.esp **between** Ultimate Skyrim.esp and Requiem for the Indifferent.esp._
2. _Install[ R-IA 1.6 UltSky 406 HF2 patch](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G6MP_qGJnUUKoLrzR3_BizkcelddyWWx/view?usp=sharing) (works with R-IA v8.0) and load the esp anywhere **between** Requiem - Immersive Abilities.esp and Requiem for the Indifferent.esp. (Note: this patch contains the file "Requiem - IA Chasing the Dragon Plus patch 1.2" needed for Requiem 3.X compatibility on the Nexus downloads page, so there is no need to install that file.)_
3. _Run the [Reqtificator](https://wiki.wildlandermod.com/16OtherResources/UltSkyFAQ/##reqtificator-questions)._

_*Installing **R-IA** mid-game is not recommended._

### Requiem - Standing Stone Rebalance (R-SSR) v3.6

**_[Mod works with US 4.0.6 HF2 out of the box]_**

_[Requiem - Standing Stone Rebalance](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/88988) works out of the box (no patching needed), since no other mods in Ult Sky change the standing stone abilities._

_To install:_



1. _Download the main file[ Requiem - Standing Stone Rebalance 3.6](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/88988?tab=files) using MO2, and install. Mod order (left side of MO) doesn't matter. On the right side, place the esp plugin **between** Ultimate Skyrim.esp and Requiem for the Indifferent.esp._
2. _[Optional] Download and install[ UltSky 4.x R-SSR MCM Standing Stone Info](https://mega.nz/file/vU8TiALY#3Xx6BdDhvI58gEsp8UWNlKXconHaXAJYq3vD2GdRclk) to update the stone descriptions in the Ult Sky MCM. This is only useful at the start of a new game. No esp plugin here, just a text file. Place it **after** Ultimate Skyrim mod on the left side of MO2._
3. _Run the [Reqtificator](https://wiki.wildlandermod.com/16OtherResources/UltSkyFAQ/##reqtificator-questions)._

_*Installing **R-SSR** on an existing save:_

_If you install R-SSR mid-game, the standing stones will be updated, but the player's active stone abilities will not be updated automatically and they need to be reset. To reset your character's active powers, travel to a different standing stone in the[ same group](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimrequiem/wiki/standing_stones#wiki_standing_stones_of_requiem_.28v_3.0.29) and activate it. Then travel back to your original standing stone and re-activate it. See the stone locations[ here](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Standing_Stone). (To speed up the process you can use 'coc' in the console to teleport to each standing stone. The "Console Location Code" is listed on the individual standing stone pages)._

**_[updated for US 4.0.6 HF2]_**

_Refer to this[ README](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mlSyUApSt5DqrgsTh_1VWJicr55u_MZR) to find out what my patch does exactly._

_To install:_

1. _Download[ Requiem - Classic Alchemy Overhaul 6.2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/86504?tab=files) and install with MO2. On the right side of MO move the esp plugin anywhere **between** Ultimate Skyrim.esp and Requiem for the Indifferent.esp. Left side of MO doesn't matter (end of the mod list is fine)._
2. _Download the patch[ R-CAO 6.2 UltSky 4.0.6 HF2 patch v2](https://drive.google.com/open?id=15ZPY7eBkEPNt_PbNaoJTpaMFuoI03tLA) and install. Move the the patch esp **between** Requiem - Classic Alchemy Overhaul.esp and Requiem for the Indifferent.esp. Left side of MO doesn't matter._
3. _Run the [Reqtificator](https://wiki.wildlandermod.com/16OtherResources/UltSkyFAQ/##reqtificator-questions). Done._

_*Installing **R-AR** on an existing save:_

_It seems to work fine when installed mid-game. Note that the mod tweaks the Alchemy tree, so if you've already acquired some of the base Requiem Alchemy perks, you may need to remove and reapply them using[ console commands](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Console_Commands_(Skyrim)/Perks), to get the new stats. Users have confirmed this worked for them._

## Rain Ash and Snow Shaders 
Rain Ash and Snow Shaders or R.A.S.S. is a shader overhaul all-in-one that aims to add slightly more realistic shaders and particle effects to NPC, Creatures and your Character. [Link Here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/103218?tab=files)

Installation Instructions:
Load after WetandCold - Ashes.esp in the right window and after Wet and Cold and Frostfall in the Left (it should be there by default anyway).

In-Game Config (best results): 
> * Turn off shader effects from Frostfall.
> * In Wet and Cold: For player and NPCs: turn off the drips in wet section, leave soggy feet, 
  snowy and breath in cold, and dusty in Ashes. 
> * In RASS disable Snowing, Swimming, and set the Raining option in Camera Visual Effects to Off, 
  this will stop disorientating focusing issues if you use the ENB's Anti-Aliasing and Depth of Field effects.

#### [Dragon Combat Overhaul (DCO)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/32597)

What the patch does:
- forwards Dragon Combat Overhaul (DCO) specific flying, acceleration and other DCO effects into a Ultsky/Requiem optimized environment.
- DCO changes to Alduin
- Conflict resolving with Requiem/Ultsky stats and perks in favor of vanilla, but DCO for specific traits.

Why you DON'T want DCO with patch in your load order.
This will hurt. Badly. Only the most masochistic player will want this in their load order.

I heartily recommend limiting the Assault MCM option to only 1 dragon until you are at VERY high levels and are comfortable fighting these dragons.

For those who are concerned about power-creep in the higher levels.... Don't worry. The Dragons are now.... bad.
just the DCO Soulfire curse that you can get from fighting these dragons will make you feel under leveled in a MOST immersive way.

You have been warned.

This will **HURT**.

[Patch location](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PBwAA7FTwnxmDy3dGZbPvnycDHbgUd_I/view?usp=sharing)

Install Instructions:

On the RIGHT side:
> - DCO above Requiem.
> - Load patch BELOW Ultimate Skyrim, ABOVE Automatic Variants (and paper world map if you have this in your load order).

On the LEFT side:
> - Doesn't matter unless you have a mod that overwrites scripts from DCO main file.

#### [Realistic Armor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/102963)

[Patch location](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qOZmcoCWNs4pUbzWdbdk4cj_HRdMHei6/view?usp=sharing)
    
What it does: Forwarded UltSky records, flags and stats where applicaple.

Be aware. Several armortypes that previously were flagged as light/evasion, are now classified as Heavy Armor.

Recipes of existing armors (that are already in UltSky and are overwritten by this mod) have for the most part crafting recipes as in UltSky.

New armors have been left untouched for now.

To be done.

Crafting recipes. Will be done when I have too much time on my hands (and I get annoyed enough).

Install Instructions:

On the RIGHT SIDE (plugins tab) in MO2:

Load Mod & patch BELOW Ultimate Skyrim, ABOVE Automatic Variants (and paper world map if you have this in your load order).

#### [Helgen Reborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35841) 

[Patch location](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16bVZFpcB1oCPhj1W5iJHzJm3DWBP4h3N/view?usp=sharing)

Install Instructions:

> - Install Helgen Reborn very high up in load order on both left and right side in MO2. (above Requiem at least. Further up to avoid chance of texture assets overriding other mods)
> - Install patch between Requiem and Ultsky on the right side in MO2. Left side should not matter.
> - Nothing ELSE with Helgen Reborn has been done. Consider this very beta. (There are some weapons that are not fixed yet that had insane damage. 10000 from vanilla mod, turned 40000 in requiem for the indifferent. What the heck those weapons are for, I do not know, but holy sh*te!)

#### [Requiem - Unarmed Combat Enhancer WITH integrated Cosmetic UCE addons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/75779?tab=files) (Download version 2.4.2 from OLD FILES)

#### [Sofia - The Funny Fully Voiced Follower](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54527?tab=description)

This file is an attempt at an update of the "Requiem 1.9.x - Sofia Follower Patch" (created by LosGrak) to Ultsky Requiem.

I have merely updated the perks in Tes5Edit, added some that seemed missing, and reinstated some of the vanilla stats that seemed appropriate. 
with regards to the perks. 

In LosGrak's words:
"This file is a patch to bring the Sofia follower, created by John Jarvis and Christine Slagman? more in line with the changes made by version 1.9.2 of the Requiem Roleplaying Overhaul. This means that her stats have been changed as well as her perks. A brief list of changes can be seen below:

Base HP, Magicka and Stamina have been set to levels fitting a Nord character. However, because she is a spell sword, she has a slight Magicka offset of 15. She has no Health or Stamina offsets.

Sofia's base combat stats have been reduced to bring her in line with a level 1 Nord character.

Several perks have been added that are both appropriate and thematic to a spell sword.

This patch does have its limitations. I am neither a true modder nor a coder. I am unable to remove control of Sofia's Health, Magicka and Stamina from her MCM, nor am I able to remove access to her infinite storage. It is up to you to not use these features.

[Patch location](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xQ-PPfb1rK79TyrVbGlxK77KECLFtCyd/view?usp=sharing)

Install Instructions:

Right Side: 
> SofiaFollower.esp before Requiem.esp
> Requiem - Sofia.esp after Requiem.esp

#### [Guards Armor Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/95719?tab=files)

Patch notes:

Forwarded UltSky values for a consistent game-world.
Except where the mod author intended that guards are also expert marksmen with full suite of requiem perks to back that up.

Set up tempering recipes to be consistent with material and crafting perks.
You will need advanced smithing to temper guard armor. Ebony for ebony armor and Dwarven for Markarth. 

(It was a mix of basic crafting for some Chest-plates, but advanced for helmets and such. Also advanced for ebony armor, and for Markaths dwarven based armor. Made little sense).

Changed armor type to steel for Solitude and Whiterun (Dwarven for Markarth, Iron for the other holds) to reflect their intended status as rich holds and to ensure the Reqtificator add in proper armor resistances.

Are considering to set Solitude to Steel Plate....."

[Patch location](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1haUrgT2wGr_oFi97napiadaMk_MfM0d6/view?usp=sharing)

Install Instructions:

You will need to install Main file through MO2.

It is **strongly** recommended a completely new play-through. Template save might work. But I do not know.

In Content\mods folder
> - Create Folder called "Guards armour Patch"
> - Save patch to folder.

On the left side in MO2
> - place Guards armour replacer (Main mod) below UltSky.
> - Place Guards armour Patch below Guards armour replacer

On the Right side 
> - place Guards_Armor_Replacer.esp between Ultsky and Paper World Map.

As always - You have to run Reqtificator.

* Gloves: +18 Lock Picking, +20 Lockpick expertise, 20% One handed, 35% Pickpocket

## No ESP mods

[Toggle Enchantment](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/78134) lets you turn on/off your weapon's enchantment when you don't want to waste the charge.

F[aster Sleep Wait (SKSE)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/95796). Decreases the time spent waiting between hours in the Sleep/Wait menu.  

[Disable Quick Save](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/82951): This mod makes the Quick-Save hot-key make a Full save instead. Use Main File.

[Smaller Cursor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2317/): Very small but great mod. Simply makes the in-game cursor smaller instead of the GIANT default one. Use Main File 

[Rudy HQ - More Lights for ENB - Bthardamz](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/95614?tab=files ): highly recommended, no ESP required. In the left window, load after Ultimate Skyrim core files.


**The following were suggested by u/PeonTheGrate on Reddit **

EZ2C DIALOGUE MENU: Makes the Dialogue menu look much nicer with a high amount of customization. I used the preset found below (Yes, I know this says Skyrim Special Edition - the author of the preset does have a habit of hiding his mod frequently so you can try asking on his discord).
- [Use Main File](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/18466)
- [YASHed/Northern Experience Preset](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23894?tab=files)

[Sleep Tight SE Fixes: Use 3rd Main File (Without Yundao Hair)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31620)
- Same as above, this mod says Skyrim Special Edition, however it’s just a script file. It works 100% fine in LE. What it does it fixes the script to where NPCs will take off their boots, gauntlets, helmet, and cape if they wear them while going to sleep. This allows you to keep the MCM option friendly sleepwear to robed like US had in the past before the bug was discovered. This makes more sense logically, and also looks much better than taking off all their clothes in the cold land of Skyrim.

[Slower Lockpick: Use Main File](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/82373?tab=files&file_id=1000237877)
- SKSE plugin that slows down (or speeds up) the lockpick on the lockpicking screen to allow more accurate control. AMAZING! I prefer changing its ini file to 0.12 instead of the 0.5 default. This makes the lockpicking screen slower but not too slow.

[Cobb Bug Fixes: Use Main File](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/96734)
- Little Plugin that fixes some bugs in the vanilla game.

[Load Game CTD Fixes: Use Main File](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/85443)
- CTD Fix that will lessen even more crashes that US already fixes.

[Dog Bark Quiet: Use Main File](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/188/)
- Small mod that makes the Dog bark a bit quieter. Muh immersion.

[Animated Clutter: Use Main File](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/48287)
- Fantastic mod that animates Clutter. Choose what you want animated in the FO-MOD. I recommend almost all of them.

[Full Screen MCM Menu for SkyUI (Option 4):](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/95924?tab=description)
- Very nice organizational/UI mod. Makes the MCM menu larger. Looks very nice, I prefer Option 4.

[Skeletons don't breathe: Use Main File](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/64312/)
- Muh Immersion! Why should Skeletons make breathing noises if they don't have lungs?

[Hircine Restoration Project: Use Main File](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/90594/)
- Make Hircine's voice sound more like the original games, very small and welcome change.

[Wash that Blood Off: Use Main File](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/98546)
- Small Immersion mod that makes blood come off you while in water.

[To Your Face(Sensible NPC Commenting: Use Main File](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/87635)
- Great mod that prevents NPC's telling you random comments just by walking behind you.

[Immersive Horses v2.5 Talking Fixes: Use Main File](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/100521)
- Bug fix for Immersive Horses that makes you talk function choose the closest NPC instead of a random one.

[Srt Crash Fixes: Use Main File](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/100672)
- Another crash fix mod that works with everything, helps prevent even more crashes.

[Quieter Thieves Guild Door: Use Main File](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/1826)
- GREAT mod that lowers the volume of the ridiculously loud Thieves Guild secret entrance in Riften.

[Simple Lock Picking Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/26490?tab=files)
- This mod removed unnecessary clutter from the Lock picking menu. I Recommend the Normal Version.

[Simple Reading UI (Take and Steal)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/74434/)
- Same as above however this mod is for the reading UI. I recommend the Take and Steal version.

[Markarth Waterfall fix for dark nights: Use Main File](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/97903)
- I call this a bug fix for ENB. Fixes the meshes for the waterfalls in Markarth to not be bright white with a ENB at night.

[No Screenshot Pop up: Use Main File](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/95802)
- Simple Plugin that makes the screenshot Pop Up go to the console instead of on the UI.

[No Poison dialogues: Use Main File](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/33916)
- Removes the dialogue submission for putting on poisons.

## What About legacy of the Dragonborn?

I was having such a nice day - why did you need to bring this up?

This mod is **NOT** recommended for install and only experienced modders who are capable of writing their own patches should even make an attempt.  

It is only being included in this document because Support are fed up about people asking what is required. 

Please don’t ask for step-by-step instructions on what to do to write a custom patch, and before you ask - no you cannot just ignore the custom patch and no we won't write one for you.

As a rough guide
1. LoTD should be installed as the last mod you are going to add to your list, so that it's FOMOD detects what mods are active and enables the appropriate content. The ESP for this should go as high in your load order as you can get it.
1. [Install patches for the base install, any additional mods you have added and Requiem](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/72921/], you need Legacy of the Dragonborn Patch Collection and Optional Mod Patches for Legacy at bare minimum for base install.  you also [need this](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/57376/?) for if you want your followers to sandbox in the safehouse.)
1. Clean added mods
1. Create merges for patches using your merge tool of choice - As you will have over 10 of them - Suggest loading this ESP just before Ultimate Skyrim.esp
1. Check for texture conflicts on the new mods/patches (E.G ETAC/LOTD conflict in Falkreath where ETAC places a tree in the Kadjit camp for the moonpath of Elswyr quest)
1. Create conflict resolution patch using Editing tool of choice - this ESP should be loaded just before paper world map in your load order. This should at minimum:-
    1. Deal with any conflicts which aren’t taken care of by the patches.  
    1. To drastically reduce the complete OP-ness of the items lotd adds
    1. LoTD conflicts with Book Covers of Skyrim (gives duplicates that you can't store at your museum), so you have to edit all those to replace with the LoTD item id, as well as levelled lists where the books drop.
    1. Deal with Texture conflicts.
1.  Rerun Dyndolod
1.  Rerun Reqtificator
