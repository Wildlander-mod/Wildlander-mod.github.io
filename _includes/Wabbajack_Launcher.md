###  Permissions error after a game crash

Typically caused by the game holding a lock on of the of the files in the launcher. A PC reboot should resolve the issue.

----------

###   Launcher crashes on startup with  a error message "unexpected end of Json input".

The settings file that the launcher uses might be corrupt.

If you hit the windows key and type %APPDATA% and hit enter it will take you to a path AppData/roaming . Go into Wildlander Launcher and delete the file userPreferences.json.
Once you've done that,  try run the launcher again.

----------
### Launching from the Wildlander launcher shows a blue dragon instead of the Wildlander Menu

1. From the Launcher - Open the Advance tab, then from there, open mod organizer.
2. go to Settings > paths > and check that the managed game is pointing to the Game-files\Stock game\SkyrimSE.exe.
3.  if it is not (e.g it's pointing at steam's version) you will need to edit it to point at the correct location.

----------
### Launcher fails to start with a mod organiser 2 crash

This error generally means that the Launcher, on install installed a Visual C++ and requires a reboot.

----------
### Trampoline Error

![image](..\..\Assets\TrampolineError.png)

This error is caused by your "My documents" folder being managed by OneDrive.

The only fix for this issue is to sever the link between OneDrive and your "my documents" folder. Adding the folder to the exceptions simply doesn't work, neither does disabling OneDrive.

The following guide will assist you in the method to do so. <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/489830/discussions/0/2263565217515804221/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guide <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-labelledby="svg-external-link-title" width="1em" height="1em"><use xlink:href="#svg-external-link"></use></svg></a>

----------
### Error launching game Error: Unsupported type of line: [1] Error OR Any message starting "TypeError:" 

This means that Mod Organizer Crashed during Boot up or Shutdown and wiped its INI files. A reinstall (overwrite) using Wabbajack of the list will resolve this issue.

1. Start up Wabbajack, search the Modlist and click the Download Button again.
2. I choose the Installation and download location to match your original install path
3. In bottom right - toggle Overwrite Installation
4. Hit the start/play Button.

An issue has been raised with launcher team to implement a backup and restore function for this file to prevent user's having to perform this action.

----------
### Getting SHGetFolderPath 00000005 failed / Assertion failed in IDebugLog.cpp 

This is generally caused by windows randomware protections "Controlled folder access".

Because SKSE isnt "approved" my microsoft - its treated as unfriendly and prevents SKSE from plugging into your SKyrimSE.exe.

Turning this option off will prevent the issue.

### Get-cimInstance Error on launch of game

This error occurs when the winmgmt service is corrupt or crashed. It can be simply repaired by

Open Command prompt and typing the following 3 commands

```
net stop winmgmt (and y if prompted)
Winmgmt /resetrepository 
Winmgmt /verifyrepository should say it's consistent.

```

### A JavaScript error in spawning the main process

Generally this is caused by an Environment variable fault with PowerShell not in the “System Variables” 'PSmodulePath' or the 'Path' Environment variables (it needs to be in both).

Type “envir” in the “Search the web and Windows” box and selected “Edit environment variables for your account” under the “Best Match”.

Path should contain an entry for your equivalent of `C:\windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\`

PSmodulePath should contain an entry for `%SystemRoot%\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules` and `%ProgramFiles%\WindowsPowerShell\Modules`

----------

### Assertion failed in Drivers\Render.CPP

Unfortunately this error is not related to the wildlander modlist itself as users who have this issue also have the same problems running other modlists with a enb. This message indicates that the ENB is failing to hook into Direct X which is a possible indication of a more serious problem with your PC.

The known causes of this issue:-

1. Overactive antivirus blocking the process. (Webroot is known to do this)
1. the use of a 'Debloater' on your windows install which has removed key files needed to hook into direct-X
1. Windows itself has issues with its system files which are preventing the connection.

Your options to resolve :-

1. Run Wildlander without using a ENB (No shaders from the launcher)
1. Identify the antivirus process blocking the ENB and add a exception or disable while running wildlander.
1. Repair/reinstall Windows.


----------
### Game doesn't boot when launching SKSE / Cannot Start SKSE_Loader Error

Ensure the following:

1.  Check that your Antivirus is not flagging SKSE or any Skyrim related files, the best Solution is to add Antivirus exceptions to the Wildlander Directory and sub-directories.   
1.  Make sure your content folder contains usvfs_proxy_x64.exe & usvfs_proxy_x86.exe. If these files are missing, it's likely your antivirus has moved them to the virus vault.    
1.  Restore missing files from Mod Organizer Zip file in your Wildlander\download directory if you cannot find them in the virus vault

----
###  Launcher locks for Skyrimse.exe and immediately unlocks (game doesn't start)

You may see a dialog pop-up saying preparing VFS and/or a command window.

This is typically caused by Antivirus interference in the installation process. Please check [Wildlander and Antiviruses](#wildlander-and-antiviruses) for specific guidance on your Anti-virus

It can also be caused by Medal.TV clipping software - which should be shut down while playing wildlander. 

It can also be caused by your own customisation of the list if you have done so.

----

### Update/Install of launcher is Hanging  

Firstly—try a PC reboot, it's possible that one of the files we use is locked by a crashed session of Wildlander.

Un-install the launcher from Add-remove programs, then download and manually install the most recent from <a href="https://github.com/Wildlander-mod/Launcher/releases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-labelledby="svg-external-link-title" width="1em" height="1em"><use xlink:href="#svg-external-link"></use></svg></a>
