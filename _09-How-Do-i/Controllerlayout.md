Notes:
* Gamepad still has some problems - you can't start sprinting if you are not moving in perfect line. You need to hold left stick perfectly up, to activate sprint. To correct go in MCM - True Directional movement - miscellaneous - Disable "Override Controller Deadzone"
* Immersive horses - Switch tabs in inventory is behaving oddly. press [select] x2 quickly to swap inventory.


Should you wish to craft and avoid CTD's, as always, do not scroll in Honed Metal crafting menu, and instead swap to keyboard. Use the filter box top right to find what you want to craft.
